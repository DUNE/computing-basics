### Instructor Guide


As much of the content will be in a reference to an active web page that utilizes a terminal window, we ask that you arrange on your computer window the web site page on the left side of your screen, and to its right, a terminal window with sufficiently large font size. A dark background with white or bright green font color might be best.

Zoom, you will "Share Screen" then select your "Full Desktop" followed by the blue "Share" button, see [Zoom Help][zoom-sharing].

Instructors are encouraged to rehearse their presentation on a Zoom link in advance of their presentations, recording the rehearsal, and in playback verify the audio track is sufficent, and that the terminal settings are adequate for a laptop user, for example.

You will be upgraded to a Zoon co-host during the workshop.
