### Instructor Guide


As much of the content will be in a reference to an active web page that utilizes a terminal window, we ask that you arrange on your computer window the web site page on the left side of your screen, and to its right, a terminal window with sufficiently large font size. A dark background with white or bright green font color might be best.

Zoom, you will "Share Screen" then select your "Full Desktop" followed by the blue "Share" button, see [Zoom Help][zoom-sharing].

Instructors are encouraged to rehearse their presentation on a Zoom link in advance of their presentations, recording the rehearsal, and in playback verify the audio track is sufficent, and that the terminal settings are adequate for a laptop user, for example.

An example screenshot follows:

{%include figure.html url="" max-width="50%"
   file="/fig/zoom-window-example.png"
   alt="Zoom Screen example" caption="Suggested window configuration for instructors." %}
