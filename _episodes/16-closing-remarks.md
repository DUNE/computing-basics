# Closing Remarks

## Three Days of Training

The instruction in this three day workshop is provided by several experienced physicists and is based on years of collaborative experience. 

The secure access to Fermilab computing systems and a familiarity with data storage are key components.

Data management and event processing tools were described and modeled. 

LArSoft was introduced, with an example of workflow so analyzers can know how to make their own module. 

Protocols for efficient job submission and monitoring has been demonstrated.

We are thankful for the instructor's hard work, and for the numerous participants who joined.
