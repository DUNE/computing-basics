## Quiz Time

Several questions will be presented as a slide show that is hosted on our [Indico event page][indico-event-page].

We ask that each breakout group quickly introduce themselves, and then discuss solutions to each of the questions.

Consider using Software Carpentry's [Etherpad][sc-etherpad] for shared dialog. 

At the end of the session, a second slide show will be posted with answers.
