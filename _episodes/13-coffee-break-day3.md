## Coffee Time

We hope that you will utilize the coffee break time to wrap on the project at hand, but to reach out to colleagues with any additional questions.

Several breakout rooms are created for this time, each hosted by a DUNE Computing Consortium member, and could perhaps respond to questions related to your analysis, or of the progress being made by the Consorium.

Breakout Room 1: Heidi Schellman and Spokesperson?  
Breakout Room 2: Michael Kirby and Steven Timm  
Breakout Room 3: Kenneth Herner and Tom Junk  
Breakout Room 4:
